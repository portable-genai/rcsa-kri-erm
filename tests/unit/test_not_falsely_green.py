"""The pii_safety metric the GATE SHIPS is proved able to go red (check E2).

The previous version of this file scored a local one-line helper defined three lines above the
assertion. It passed, and it proved nothing about the gate: the shipped metric read
``redacted_summary`` and nothing else, which is the ONE field the redactor was already masking,
so it asked the redactor whether it had redacted and believed the answer. It reported
``pii_safety 1.000 PASS`` for a run whose audit citation carried the identifier verbatim.

So the falsification runs against ``run_eval`` itself, imported as the gate imports it, and the
mutant is the leak the metric exists to catch: the SAME row, summary clean either way, differing
only in the citation. A metric that reads the wrong field cannot tell the two apart and stays
green on the red input, which is exactly the failure ``assert_can_go_red`` refuses.
