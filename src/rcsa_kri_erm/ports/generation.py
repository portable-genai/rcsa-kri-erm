"""GenerationPort: the LLM boundary, kept strictly to narration.

The determinism rule of this catalog is that consequential math and verdicts are pure code and
the model only narrates. This port is where the model lives, so its contract is deliberately
narrow: it turns a request (a system instruction, a prompt, the engine facts and the expected
response keys) into raw text, and nothing more. The domain owns the numbers; the narration
service validates the model's text against a schema and discards it on failure, so a model that
invents a figure changes nothing a caller relies on.

The domain stays pure: this is a Protocol. The adapters reach a real model under the managed
profile, answer deterministically offline, and fail fast on-premises.
