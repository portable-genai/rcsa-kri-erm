"""Shared conversion from an escalated result to an ``review-kit`` Review payload.

Lives in the adapter layer, not the pure domain, because it depends on the kit. EVERY content field
is redacted BEFORE it leaves the process (the same redact-before-anything rule the audit write
obeys), using the shared ``pii-kit``, so no raw identifier reaches human-review-console over the
wire; human-review-console redacts again before its own audit write (defence in depth). "Every" is
written out here because the earlier version masked ``subject``, ``summary`` and the citation
``snippet`` while ``case_ref``, ``source_key`` and the citation ``source_id`` and ``title`` carried
the same text raw. ``maker`` and ``tenant`` are asserted here and trusted by human-review-console
because the caller is an authenticated S2S service; per-hop on-behalf-of token exchange is the
deferred next layer.
